# segmenting_cnn
A Convolutional Neural Network for automatic semantic segmentation of confocal microscopy images.

Currently written to handle 2D images of confluent tissues (where plasma membrane markers clearly and brightly label the border of each cell), but can be adapted to take 3D image volumes as input.
